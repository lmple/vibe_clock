# Specification Quality Checklist: Two-Part Report Layout

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- This feature restructures the existing `report` command output: replaces project-grouped layout with a two-part layout (summary table + per-day breakdown). The old layout is fully removed per the Assumptions section.
- Key change from current behaviour: task descriptions are currently truncated at 30 characters; FR-004 removes this truncation entirely.
- PDF export (feature 002) must also be updated to reflect the new structure (US3 / FR-007).
